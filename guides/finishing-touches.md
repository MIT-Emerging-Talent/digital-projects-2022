# Finishing Touches

If you do a good job on your project you can add it to your public portfolio and
share it with future employers or collaborators. Here are some tips for putting
your best foot forward:

## Repository Description

The first thing people will often see is your repository's description. It's a
small detail, but a good description makes a project feel more professional.

## The README

Take a little extra time throughout your projects to proofread your READMEs. Is
the spelling correct? Is the writing clear and to the point? Is it well
organized? You want someone to read your project's README and not only learn
something interesting, but also to find it pleasant.

## Planning Documents, Project Board & Repository Activity

This is how you will set yourselves apart from everyone else in the world who
knows a little bit of programming and statistics. You want to show future
employers and collaborators that you work well in a group, can plan+manage your
own tasks and understand more than just the technical details of a data science
project.

## Your Communication Artefact

Show that your group can "close the triangle" and make a realistic plan for
acting on your findings. A lot of people can find a problem in the world or
learn something new, it's much more impressive when someone knows what to do
about it!

## Your Data & Code

The technical details of these project are important, but they are just one
small part of a bigger picture. What's important is to share what you _really_
understand, not to use the fanciest or most powerful tools available.

So it's ok if your code is nothing more than a few small scripts! Just be sure
that your code is tidy and has lots of comments describing what your code is
supposed to do, and why you wrote it this way.
