# Project Phases

You should approach your group project in 5 phases, each phase building on the
last:

1. [_Planning & Scoping_](#1-planning--scoping)
2. [**Domain & Data**](#2-domain--data)
3. [**Analysis & Results**](#3-analysis--results)
4. [**Audience & Communication**](#4-audience--communication)
5. [_Retrospective_](#5-retrospective)

Professional projects will not follow such a clear path, but this process is
easier to learn and will prepare you for larger and less structured projects in
your future.

## Divergent and Convergent Thinking

To help structure your group work, you will practice alternating between two
different modes of thinking in each phase of your project:

- **Divergent Thinking**: Explore without saying "no". Try crazy ideas, learn
  and listen without judgement. By the end of this phase you should have a broad
  understanding of the what you are working on.
- **Convergent Convergent**: Strategically narrow your thinking and start saying
  "no". By the end of this phase you should have a clear solution or conclusion.

You can visualize their relationship with a diamond like this:

You will approach the beginning of each phase with an open mind, practicing
_divergent thinking_. After having explored many options your group will need to
switch to convergent thinking in order to finish your work in that phase of the
project on schedule.

There is no magic answer for how long to spend in each side of the diamond or
when to transition from one side to the next. It's more of a helpful metaphor
than a strict recipe.

## 1. Planning & Scoping

Clearly define your research project. You should be able explain why you think
this research fits within within your group's constraints and the project
timeline.

## 2. Domain & Data

Research your domain and prepare the data you will need for the next phase. You
should be able to explain possible flaws in your data and defend why it is still
good enough to use.

## 3. Analysis & Results

Carefully study your data to understand what you can learn from it, it's ok to
conclude "the data is inconclusive!". You should be able to explain how your
conclusion is supported by the data, and what data might exist that could
disprove your conclusion.

## 4. Audience & Communication

Communicate your results to your audience. You should be able to explain your
audience's objectives, expectations and limitations. You should also be able to
explain how you designed your communication to meet your audience where they
are.

## 5. Retrospective

After everything is finished, get together as a group to discuss what went well
and what went less well. You should be able to give an honest evaluation of your
group's performance along with a clear plan to do better next time.
