# Check-Ins

Each group should create a `check-in` issue every week of the project. These
check-ins are how you will share your progress with your classmates and TAs. TAs
will also use your check-ins to prepare for review calls and project feedback.

## Weekly Check-In

Each week your group you will create a new check-in issue summarizing your
progress over the last week. You will need to fill in these sections:

- **We Need Help with**: What are you having trouble understanding? What parts
  of the project are you struggling to complete?
- **What went well?**: What has been successful so far? have you learned and/or
  completed so far this week?
- **What went less well?**: What mistakes did you and/or your group make? What
  was difficult?
- **Start Doing**: What will you start doing next week that you didn't do this
  week?
- **Continue Doing**: What did you do well that you want to continue doing next
  week?
- **Stop Doing**: What will you stop doing next week that you did this week?
- **Lessons Learned**: What did you learn this week that you will take with you
  into next week? It can be technical, a mindset, a study habit, anything!

## Closing Your Check-Ins

You should leave your issue open until your group has resolved any problems in
_We Need Help With_, then you can close it.
