# Learning In Public

Learning in public is the simple idea that you share as much of your learning
process as you can with the whole world. Swyx said it best
[right here](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). (and it's even a
[hastag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LearnInPublic?src=hash))

During the group projects you should do as much of your learning as possible in
public, though it is OK to do some
[learning in private](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private) when necessary.
Sharing your learning process will help you meet your classmates to learn from
each other.

## Personal Study Repository

You can share your individual learning in a GitHub repository called
`learning-in-public`, there's no rules on how you should organize it or what it
should contain.

There is a link to each of your classmates' study repos in the class README
under their name. If you're blocked or looking for inspiration take some time to
read through your classmates' notes. You might just find what you're looking
for!

## Shared Class Notes

When you think you've come across something that everyone will need, you can
share it by sending a pull request to the `/shared-notes` folder of this
repository. This might be a link, some exercises, a cheat sheet, your own
explanations ... anything you think will help you classmates finish their
projects.

The most important thing to keep in mind when contributing to `/shared-notes` is
to keep things tidy!

- Don't contribute something that's already there. Instead of adding the same
  thing twice, you can instead improve what's already there.
- Keep the folder well organized. If you notice the `/shared-notes` folder is
  getting messy, maybe it's time to send a pull request with a more organized
  folder structure.
- Try to stay consistent. Using a naming convention for your file/folder names
  and trying to format your markdown files consistently will make
  `/shared-notes` much easier for others to study.
