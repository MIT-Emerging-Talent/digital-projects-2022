# Planning and Collaboration

Before beginning your data science projects you will have time to practice Git,
GitHub, project management, and collaborative development by following the study
path in this [Workflows repository](https://github.com/DeNepo/workflows).

We recommend that you and your study group practice contributing to shared
markdown-only repositories, even something as simple as adding one file per
member introducing yourselves. For extra practice with writing clean code,
following conventions and conducting code review, you can generate your
repositories from [this template](https://github.com/DeNepo/template-markdown).

Take a moment to read through the rest of this file. It introduces 3 planning
documents your group will learn to use:

1. [Communication Plan](#communication-plan)
2. [Setting Constraints](#setting-constraints)
3. [Retrospective](#retrospective)

## Communication Plan

Decide as a team when you will be able to meet, and how you'll stay in touch
between meetings. The starter in your project repository will give you a
starting point, but it's up to your group to find what works best for you.

This step may seem simple but it's soooo important. 10 weeks may seem like a
long time, but the project will go by very quickly! Taking a few extra minutes
to plan your communication ahead of time will save hours in the long run.

## Setting Constraints

After dreaming big, the most helpful thing you can can do to define your project
is to be realistic and be clear about what it isn't. Thinking big is great for
brainstorming but can get in the way of finishing your projects on time (or even
at all).

An important step to scoping your project is to discuss your group's constraints
before you begin any work. Defining your constraints will help you scope and
commit to a realistic project. Constraints can also help you to build a more
creative project!

It may not sound intuitive, but the fewer constraints you have on your work the
less likely you are to find a creative solution. The important skill to learn is
how defining constructive constraints on your project and on your team.

## Retrospective

> “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone
> did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills
> and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”

You're finished! Now it's time as a group to look back at how the project went
and to learn for next time.

### Behaviors, not People!

Focus on what your group can _do_ that will make the next sprint better. A huge
list of things to stop doing doesn't help you move forward.

Retrospectives are all about behaviors that can be changed, not people that need
fixing. Keep your retrospectives _positive_ and _general_. **_You should NEVER
mention people by name!!!_**

### The Four Points

Your group will summarize your work by providing answers to these four
questions. You can have more than one answer! You can answer with bullet points,
paragraphs, links, images ... whatever is most clear.

- **Stop Doing**: what mistakes did you make? did you miss a step? could your
  communication have been better? be specific!
- **Continue Doing**: what went well that you should continue doing in the next
  project? be specific!
- **Start Doing**: any good ideas you'd like to try out in the next project? be
  specific!
- **Lessons Learned**: what cool things or general lessons has your team
  learned? This can be about anything, not just code!
