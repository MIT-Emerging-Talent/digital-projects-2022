# Project Repository

Each group will host their project in the MIT ReACT GitHub organization, this
will make it easy for your classmates and TAs to find everyone's projects. It
will also help future MIT ReACT learners to find and study your projects.

Before diving into your project make sure your team has all the practical things
in place:

## Create and Share a Repository

As a team you will choose the name for your project's repository and select
someone from your team to be the repo owner. This person will create a new
repository from
[this template](https://github.com/MIT-ReACT/digital-projects-template) in the
MIT ReACT org.

## Collaboration Settings

- Add everyone in your team as a contributor with _Admin_ access
- Require a code review for PRs to `main`/`master`
  \([owanateamachree](https://owanateamachree.medium.com/how-to-protect-the-master-branch-on-github-ab85e9b6b03),
  [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews)\)
  - You will need to type `main` or `master` into the _Branch name pattern_
    input box \(depending on which on what your repo's default branch is named\)
  - Select _Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed_
- Create your group project issue in the Class Repository and assign all your
  team members

## Code Quality Scripts & CI

The template repository does not come with any scripts to format, check or lint
your code. It also does not come with any continuous integration scripts for
pull requests on GitHub.

If your group decides you would like to have these, take some time to decide
which tools you should use before setting it up. You should take into account
things like:

- Which programming language(s) will you use?
- What domain are you working in? Which tools are conventional in this domain?
- Does your team already have experience with some tools?

## Code of Conduct

A code of conduct sets the expectation that everyone contributing to your
project will treat each other with respect, and what happens if they do not.
There are many Codes of Conduct already available online, you can learn more
about them from:

- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
- [opensourceconduct.com](https://opensourceconduct.com/)
- [opensourcedesign.net](https://opensourcedesign.net/code-of-conduct/)
- [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/)

## Contributor Guidelines

Contributor Guidelines are important to standardize coding practices and
workflows for an Open Source project. You could think of it as describing how
the code should be treated:
